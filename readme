# Job Description Parser

## Overview
This Python script extracts key responsibilities, qualifications, and skills from a given job description using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It leverages `spaCy` for text processing and `KeyBERT` for keyword extraction.

## Features
- Extracts **Responsibilities** from job descriptions based on specific keywords.
- Identifies **Qualifications** such as required degrees, experience, and certifications.
- Detects **Key Skills** using `KeyBERT` for keyword extraction.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install spacy keybert
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage
1. Import the function `extract_job_details` from the script.
2. Pass a job description as a string.
3. The function will return a dictionary containing responsibilities, qualifications, and extracted skills.

### Example
```python
from job_description_parser import extract_job_details

job_desc = """We are looking for an experienced Software Engineer to develop and maintain scalable applications.
The candidate will be responsible for designing, coding, and reviewing software solutions.

job_details = extract_job_details(job_desc)

print("Responsibilities:")
print("\n".join(job_details["Responsibilities"]))
print("\nQualifications:")
print("\n".join(job_details["Qualifications"]))
print("\nSkills:")
print(", ".join(job_details["Skills"]))
```
